# Logo Placeholder

To add your business logo to invoices:

1. Place your logo image here as `logo.png`
2. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels
3. Format: PNG with transparent background

The logo will automatically appear in:
- PDF invoices (top right corner)
- Invoice preview screen
- Printed invoices

If no logo is present, invoices will still generate without it.
